A SIG is an extension of a Committee, in that its only deliverables are strategy, gaps, and prioritizations, and helping spawn other SIGs or TGs to fill the gaps. A good SIG charter spells out the small set of topic areas their strategy will address along with its responsibilities as laid out in this bullet.
